# B2B Website - but with the navbar in the portal !! (super cool)

Ensure:
NodeJS installed
A code editor (I use VSCode)

## How to run it

Click Code, and copy the HTTPS link.
Open code editor, open a new terminal (button called terminal at the top).
Run command git clone <insert HTTPS link here>
Run command <npm install> to install all the dependencies.
Run command <npm run dev> and there will hopefully be a link to a localhost.
Open that !!

## If there are issues
Check if node is installed by running node -v (there will be a version number, something like v20.17.0) !!
